> For this lesson we will be using the [Docker containers images](https://katilp.github.io/opendata-howto-docker-pre-exercise/03-docker-for-cms-opendata/#download-the-container-images-needed-in-the-open-data-introduction) you already downloaded and tested during the [docker pre-exercise](https://katilp.github.io/opendata-howto-docker-pre-exercise/).  
>
> Reminder: Windows users are expected to have WSL2 installed and work in the Ubuntu Linux shell (**not** in the Windows command prompt or the git bash shell) as instructed in the [pre-exercise setup](https://katilp.github.io/opendata-howto-docker-pre-exercise/setup.html).
