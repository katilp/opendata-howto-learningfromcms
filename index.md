**Welcome to learning about open data!**

This tutorial is a bottom-up approach to open data prepared for the Science Day on Open Data of the  Atoms, Light, and Molecules doctoral program at the University of Innsbruck.

It is based on the personal experience of the author, coordinator of the "Data preservation and open access" (DPOA) project of the CMS experiment at CERN since the approval of the "CMS data preservation, re-use and open access policy" in 2012.

CMS has released into the public domain more than 3 TB of research-quality data since 2014, and the main objective of the DPOA project is to maintain and improve the usability of these data. This tutorial draws on that experience and illustrates some of the key points of providing open data through the tools and exercises developed for CMS open data users.

This is the first attempt to use the expertise in CMS open data to illustrate the main concepts of open data to researchers in other domains. The tutorial pays special attention to the differences between open data from CMS, one of the largest research collaborations in the world, and the smaller-scale research domains as those of most of the participants, but some bias is inevitable.
