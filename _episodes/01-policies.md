## Open data policies

Providing open data is regulated with open data policies. They can be at the level of

- institutions (institute/ university/ funding agency)
- research groups or collaborations.

Let us first have a look at the data policies for the LHC experiments at CERN. They are at two levels.

CERN has defined an open data policy for the LHC experiments.

Each experiment has its own open data policy that specifies the details of

- what type of data is released
- what else is provided with the actual data (environments, software, workflows)
- what is the amount of data to be released
- what is the timeline for the data releases.

> ## Note!
>
> There are different data "levels". For particle physics data, in particular, we distinguish:
>
> - collision and simulated event data used as input to physics analyses
> - workflows and data products connected to specific analyses.
>
> This may be different in other research fields.

> Find out how the four points above are described in the [CERN open data policy](http://cds.cern.ch/record/2745133/files/CERN-OPEN-2020-013.pdf?version=1) (see under "Reconstructed Data (Level 3) Policy").

> ## Do you have such open data policies?
>
> Discuss what are the policies that apply to your work.

{: .discussion}

> ## Open data policy is important!
>
> Data policies can be formal and boring, but they are important! 
>
> - Agreeing upon a policy can be a lengthy process within a group or a collaboration, but it avoids discussing it over and over again.
> - Protecting work done within the collaboration is a key factor in the data policy.

## Guidelines for research integrity

Whether or not your are required to provide open data, you should follow a code of conduct for research integrity, see for example [The European Code of Conduct for
Research Integrity](http://www.allea.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017-1.pdf). Your institutions may have similar documents.

Two separate topics related to research integrity are of importance in our context:
- Preserving what is necessary for reproducibility of your research results.
- Agreeing on the use of open data and/or commonly developed software by the members of a research group or a collaboration.
