## Open data policies

Providing open data is regulated with open data policies. They can be at the level of

- institutions (institute/ university/ funding agency)
- research groups or collaborations.

Let us first have a look at the data policies for the LHC experiments at CERN.

CERN has defined an open data policy for the LHC experiments.

Each experiment has its own open data policy that specifies the details of

- what type of data is released
- what else is provided with the actual data (environments, software, workflows)
- what is the amount of data to be released
- what is the timeline for the data releases.

> ## Do you have such open data policies?
>
> Discuss what are the policies that apply to your work.

> ## Open data policy is important!
>
> Data policies can be formal and boring, but they are important! 
>
> - Agreeing upon a policy can be a lengthy process within a group or a collaboration, but it avoids discussing it over and over again.
> - Protecting work done within the collaboration is a key factor in the data policy.

## Guidelines for research integrity

Use of open data or software by the members of a research group or a collaboration.


Whether or not your are required to provide open data, you should follow the guidelines for research integrity...
