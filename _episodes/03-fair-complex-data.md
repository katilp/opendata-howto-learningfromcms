title: "FAIR principles for complex research data"
teaching: 10
exercises: 30
questions:
- "What does FAIR mean for complex research data"
objectives:
- "See what is needed be describe CMS data so that they can be reused"
- "Observe how the challenges for complex research data are addressed in CMS open data records"
- "Reflect on reusability of your own research data"
keypoints:
- "Making data open does not make them simple"
- "Describing complex research data so that they are reusable can get involved"
- "Open data users are expected to invest time in learning"

In the following, we take the example of CMS open data. Note that we have the luxury of having the [CERN open data portal](http://opendata.cern.ch/) through which all CMS open data can be searched and distributed.

> ## Note on repositories
>
> - Do you have such repositories at your disposal?
> - Would they make your open data FINDABLE and ACCESSIBLE?

## CMS open data records

We'll go through a quick exercise.

> ## Metadata
>
> - Discuss in groups what you think is necessary to describe an open data dataset in a repository (5 mins). List the items. These would the metadata fields.
>
{: .challenge}

Now, let us have a look at some CMS open data records: e.g. [collison dataset from 2015](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/24120) or a [simulated dataset for the same period](http://opendata.cern.ch/record/16452).

> ## Your observations of metadata in CMS open data records?
>
> - Without background in particle physics, how much do you understand of them?
> - Is there something obvious missing?
> - What's your impression: are these metadata enough to make the data usable?

## Accessing data

CMS has released more than 3 PB of open data. All that amount is not needed for research-level work on these data, but certainly several TB's or data need to be accessed.

CMS open data is most commonly accessed "streaming" during the analysis job runtime, but the data files can be downloaded with a https download if desided.
