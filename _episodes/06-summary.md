## Conclusion

Your data may be

- complex
- not quite adequately described
- usable in a very specific environment

and you are not sure of the quality of any usage examples you are able to provide.

None of these is a valid excuse not to make them open!

Modern software tools exist to help you make them FAIR. 

If you use them from the start of your data analysis process and follow best coding practices, you will make your work accessible - first of all - to your future self and to other people in your research collaborations, and - once publicly released as agreed with your collaborators - to others.

## Discussion and feedback

> This tutorial relies on the work done by my CMS open data colleagues: Clemens Lange, Edgar Carrera, Julie Hogan, Thomas McCauley, Matthew Bellis, and many others, and the expertise has been built in collaboration with - and learning from - the CERN open data services.
